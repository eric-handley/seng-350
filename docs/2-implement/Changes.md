There were no modifications to our plan for implementation II as we were able to complete everything we planned to.

Additionally, we completed the following out-of-scope parts from Implementation I:
- Updated test coverage thresholds and specified them in package.json line 24:
 {\"branches\":50,\"functions\":70,\"statements\":70,\"lines\":80}

- Implemented Recurring Bookings

- Implemented Redis Caching
