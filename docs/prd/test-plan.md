Our test plan is based of skills learned in Seng 321, software testing. We are planning to use unit testing during development, E2E testing through scripting once the development is near finished. Integration testing, property testing and system testing. We are also setting up a test pipleine for the main project branch.

coverage targets: We are looking for 80% branch coverage as our coverage to be confident in our code quality.

test tools: Jest, pipeline through gitlab

test types: unit testing through Jest for fast bug detection, E2E tests for user journey correctness, integration testing for real system wiring validation, property testing and system testing.

key risks the tests will examine: Our tests will be examining the key risks of integration failiure via integration testing
