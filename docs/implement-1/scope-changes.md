## Scope Management Document

A document `ScopeChanges.md`, in the main repo:

  - a summary of the scope of work your team anticipated in the Design phase (e.g., the user stories you created)
  - the challenges encountered in addressing that scope, e.g., difficulty with Gitlab, time pressures, AI hallucinations.
  - the revised/reduced scope addressed in the work completed in Cycle 1. Estimate the percentage of deliverables completed and remaining. 

Please use this short document to explain where the client's vision (Neil's vision) was unrealistic and impossible to meet. The revised scope will be the basis for the marks in the Features and Requirements Coverage portions of the marking rubric.

This document will be evaluated relative to your team's repository and work record. Your document should reflect what is visible in the repository as evidence for the revised scope. 

What would be a problem:
- little evidence of work in Gitlab (e.g., very few lines committed)
- poor lab and class attendance.
- last minute AI code slop as evidence of work happening.
- scope changes due to lack of effort or willingness to get assistance.
